Our project, VogueX, is designed to revolutionize the fashion recommender system by enhancing user experience and integrating cutting-edge features. We improved user authentication with email and OTP verification, providing a more secure sign-up process.

Users can now input details like culture, gender, age, location, occasion, and date to receive tailored outfit recommendations. The real-time weather API integration ensures that users get suggestions suited to current conditions, while curated content links to YouTube videos and fashion sites offer a comprehensive view of options.

Additionally, users can save their favorite outfits, which display associated occasions, and our calendar integration recognizes specific dates to suggest appropriate attire.

The standout feature is our virtual try-on modules, allowing users to see how different clothing, accessories, and hairstyles look on them by simply uploading their images. This interactive experience not only makes fashion fun but also personalized, as users can mix and match outfits and share their looks for instant feedback. With VogueX, we aim to create a truly innovative and user-friendly fashion assistant.
