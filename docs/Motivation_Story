Imagine waking up, glancing at your calendar, and realizing you have an event later. The first thought? What on earth should I wear?
I wanted to create a solution that could take the guesswork out of moments like these—one that felt less like an app and more like a personal stylist guiding you.
That’s how VogueX came to life. Users can enter simple details—culture, age, location, occasion—and VogueX takes it from there. 
It doesn’t just throw random outfits your way; it considers the weather, knows that December 25th is Christmas, and gives you options tailored to each occasion. 
I wanted it to feel thoughtful and detailed. Then I took it a step further: imagine being able to see yourself in those outfits right from your device. With virtual try-ons for clothes, accessories,
and hairstyles, you can now visualize each piece on you, no fitting rooms required.For me, VogueX isn’t just about recommendations—it’s about making fashion fun, interactive, and completely personal.
